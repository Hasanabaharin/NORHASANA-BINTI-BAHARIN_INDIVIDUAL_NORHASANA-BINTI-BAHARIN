        <p> for my life experience during these 20 years, it is still a little and needs to be collected, but there is still something I can share ... I get more experiences when I am away from my family. it was the first time I had to be separated from my family and I was excited but there were times when I cried because I missed them and wanted to go home because I started to feel unbearable living in a hostel. when in the beginning I found it difficult to make friends because of fear and embarrassment, then there was also a misunderstanding that led to a long fight that made me not forget this. It was a bit painful but I accepted it with an open heart and hoped everything would be fine one day. Among the sweet experiences that can be shared is when with friends no matter how hard or easy. we are not many so one of the ones I miss the most when we eat, sleep, study and walk together in those 5 years is very short and still not enough. this was the sweetest moment I remember and love the most because our batch was a batch that was disliked by a handful of teachers but we remained strong and always together. these sweet memories are also sad when the spm is over we will each take our own path and it is not easy to meet again but I believe there are times when our mates can still meet and can make new sweet memories.</p>

        <p>Doing and managing such a big event is not an easy task. cooperation between teams must be strong to succeed. that’s how I felt when doing a teacher’s day party at school with all my classmates during form five. Each of us has a responsibility in each task and we work hard to prepare until we can't sleep at night because we are worried about whether the ceremony will go smoothly or not because it is the first time for me and my friends. on the day of the incident there were some problems that happened but they could be dealt with, so it was an experience and a lesson for me because from here we can learn the meaning of cooperation in life. while at Uitm, I was given the opportunity to manage a very large event in a field. i felt nervous about having to be the group leader for a given task. Everything went smoothly as planned but unexpectedly after the end of the program I was scolded by the supreme council member for not carrying out his duties. I felt very sad that day because there was a misunderstanding of them against me. I felt very embarrassed but I persevered and I remember to this day.</p>

        <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>My experience life in university and experience in online distance learning in pandemic</b></h5>
        <h6 class="w3-text-teal"><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw w3-margin-right"></i>2019-2022</h6>
        <p>before entering uitm kedah i entered form 6 for 2 days in a religious secondary school but chose not to continue because i don't want to go to school anymore. When in uitm between experiences or sweet memories that I will never forget when meeting 4 good friends that I really love, they are the ones who always support and take care of me no matter how hard they are happy they will still be there and they make me feel often grateful to have friends like them. This is a wonderful destiny because at first I myself was afraid to go through the time of studying at the university but the presence of good and sincere people around made me fun to study and start life here. during this pandemic also I was able to meet them this last semester in college and it was very pleasant after almost a year of not being able to meet. The pandemic era too, as is known is the era of difficult online learning but still needs to be faced calmly and strongly. it was during this odl that I learned how difficult it would be when I was not surrounded by friends to help me if I was difficult quickly. So I always say to myself I need to learn to depend on myself from now on because not every time there will be someone beside me.
